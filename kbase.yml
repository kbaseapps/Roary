module-name:
    Roary

module-description:
    Roary is a high speed Pan Genome pipeline. Roary is not intended for meta-genomics or for comparing \
    extremely diverse sets of genomes. In order to achieve this speed up of the NP-hard task of Pan Genome \
    assembly, Roary is non-deterministic. 
    The SDK application for Roary accepts a GenomeSet with two or more Genomes as input and returns a downloadable \
    csv, two graphs, and summary statistics as well an optional Pangenome object.
